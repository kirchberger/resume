% Projects
\begin{rSection}{Projects}
\begin{rSubsection}{\href{https://github.com/kirchberger/WFR-24E_ECU}{WFR-24E ECU}}{}{}{}
\item Main controller for the Western Formula Racing Formula SAE car, based on a Teensy 4.1 development board.
\item The controller interfaces with all the components within the car, such as the motor inverter over CAN.
\item For this year the car was converted from a one controller system to a 2 controller sysyem to reduce overall wiring harness complexity and specifically the wiring from front to rear.
\end{rSubsection}
\begin{rSubsection}{\href{https://github.com/kirchberger/Light_Shows/tree/main/WLED-v1}{WLED Light Controller}}{}{}{}
\item ESP32 based light controller, utilizing open source WLED software used for light shows.
\item The controller contains 4 powered pixel outputs capable of controlling up to 4048 pixels.
